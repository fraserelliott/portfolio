# My Portfolio

This was created as part of a bootcamp for a level 4 qualification in full stack development. I've used HTML and CSS to make a portfolio showcasing my projects I have made so far including a section about myself, a section about my projects and a section to contact me.

I used a suggested colour palette from https://colorhunt.co/palette/3334467f8caab8cfceeaefef and made the header bar by increasing the values of this slightly i.e. #333446 became #444557.

I used inline-blocks for the project section and contact section to have each appear side by side, with a set width and height to give a clean look to the page. This also allows it to scale with the screen size i.e. in a wider window you can display more projects side by side.
