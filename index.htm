        <h2>About me</h2><br>
        <p>
        Welcome to my portfolio! I am a hobbyist developer with experience mostly in C# building 
        desktop appplications and games. I am currently doing a level 4 qualification in full stack
        development. This website was built as part of the course. My academic background is in
        mathematics and statistics and I'm looking to apply my problem solving skills in a career
        in development.<br>

            <p>This was a project I made to support a gaming community in solving a puzzle game, CodeBreaker,
                in the game Persona 1. I found this particularly interesting to make as it combined my love of gaming
                with my background in statistics and problem solving.<br>
