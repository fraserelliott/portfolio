            Welcome to my portfolio! I am a hobbyist developer with experience mostly in C# building desktop appplications and games. I am currently doing a level 4 qualification in full stack development. This website was built as part of the course. My academic background is in mathematics and statistics and I'm looking to apply my problem solving skills in a career in development.<br><br>

            I've used a range of technologies as I've been learning to program including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>C#</li>
                <li>PHP</li>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>Java (including the Java Android SDK)</li>
                <li>WPF</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories is a game that people like to try to complete as quickly as possible. This program was created to help runners of Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories to show the progress of their deck during a run or race. Tools available at the time did not have all of the features I wanted, so I made this.<br>

            <p>This was a project I made to support a gaming community in solving a puzzle game, CodeBreaker, in the game Persona 1. I found this particularly interesting to make as it combined my love of gaming with my background in statistics and problem solving.<br>

            <p>This is an ongoing project to develop a portfolio website - this very website you are looking at now. It was made in a bootcamp for a level 4 qualification in full stack development.<br>
